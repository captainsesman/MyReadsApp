# MyReads Project

This is the completed starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 
In this project I was able to Build the MyReadApp. Basic components of the App were broken into components.
The basic Template was refactored and interactivity added to meet the requirement

## TL;DR

To use the App follow the Instructions Below:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Backend Server
The backend server provided the API file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) which contains the methods I used to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)


## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students which I was given to complete the project. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
